// HackerLand National Bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fraudulent account activity.
// If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to  the client's median spending
// for a trailing number of days, they send the client a notification about potential fraud.
// The bank doesn't send the client any notifications until they have at least that trailing number of prior days'
//transaction data.
// Given the number of trailing days d and a client's total daily expenditures for a period of n days,
//determine the number of times the client will receive a notification over all  n days.

List <int> sendNotifications(int n, int d) {
  
  // Your code here
  int notificationCount = 0;

  for( int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    
  }
}
